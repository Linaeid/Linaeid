 STC Program Recommendation System 


 Project Description:

This project aims to create a simple program recommendation system for the STC (Saudi Telecom Company) platform. The system suggests personalized program recommendations to users based on their past interactions with content. By analyzing user-program interaction data, the system helps users discover relevant and interesting programs within the STC platform.

Problem:

Users often struggle to find content that aligns with their preferences and interests on the STC platform due to the sheer volume of available programs. Without personalized recommendations, users may spend considerable time searching for content, leading to a less than optimal user experience.

Solution:

The program recommendation system addresses this problem by leveraging collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user behavior and generate personalized recommendations. By identifying patterns in user-program interactions, the system recommends programs that are likely to be of interest to each user, thereby enhancing the user experience and increasing engagement with the platform.

Benefits:

Simplifies content discovery for users.
Improves user satisfaction and engagement.
Increases user retention and loyalty to the STC platform.
Enhances overall user experience by providing relevant and personalized recommendations.
